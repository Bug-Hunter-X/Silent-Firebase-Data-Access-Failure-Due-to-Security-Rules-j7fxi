# Silent Firebase Data Access Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase where data access failures due to security rules are not explicitly reported, causing unexpected silent failures in client-side code.

## The Problem

When a client attempts to access data it doesn't have permission to read, Firebase's security rules should ideally return a clear and informative error.  However, under certain conditions the `once()` method might fail silently, making debugging a frustrating experience. The attached JavaScript code illustrates this scenario.

## The Solution

The solution addresses this issue by enhancing error handling to detect silent access failures. The solution file, `bugSolution.js`, provides an improved approach for handling these cases and reporting more informative error messages.
