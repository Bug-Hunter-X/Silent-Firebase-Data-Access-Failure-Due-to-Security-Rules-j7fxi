The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and data retrieval.  This error occurs when a client attempts to access data that it doesn't have permission to read, but the error message isn't always clear, leading to debugging challenges.

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('privateData').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.val()); // This might throw an error silently
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error fetching data:', error); // This might not catch the permission error
});
```

The problem is that the Firebase security rules might be overly restrictive, causing the `once()` method to fail silently instead of returning a clear error.  The `catch` block might not capture this specific type of failure. This is uncommon because developers often expect a specific error message when permissions are violated.
